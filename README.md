- Block Time: 1m 2s
- Block Reward: 3 KMD
- Mining Algorithm: Equihash

## About this Project
Komodo is based on Zcash and has been extended by our innovative consensus algorithm called dPoW which utilizes Bitcoin's hashrate to store Komodo blockchain information into the Bitcoin blockchain. Other new and native Komodo features are the privacy technology called JUMBLR, our assetchain capabilities (one click plug and play blockchain solutions) and a set of financial decentralization and interoperability technologies. More details are available under https://komodoplatform.com/ and https://blog.komodoplatform.com.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

```shell
#The following packages are needed:
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl
```

### Build Komodo

This software is based on zcash and considered experimental and is continously undergoing heavy development.

The dev branch is considered the bleeding edge codebase while the master-branch is considered tested (unit tests, runtime tests, functionality). At no point of time do the Komodo Platform developers take any responsbility for any damage out of the usage of this software. 
Komodo builds for all operating systems out of the same codebase. Follow the OS specific instructions from below.

#### Linux
```shell
git clone https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```


#### OSX
Ensure you have [brew](https://brew.sh) and Command Line Tools installed.
```shell
# Install brew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# Install Xcode, opens a pop-up window to install CLT without installing the entire Xcode package
xcode-select --install 
# Update brew and install dependencies
brew update
brew upgrade
brew tap discoteq/discoteq; brew install flock
brew install autoconf autogen automake
brew install gcc@6
brew install binutils
brew install protobuf
brew install coreutils
brew install wget
# Clone the Komodo repo
git clone https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo --branch master --single-branch
# Change master branch to other branch you wish to compile
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8
# This can take some time.
```

#### Windows
Use a debian cross-compilation setup with mingw for windows and run:
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl cmake mingw-w64
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build-win.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```
**komodo is experimental and a work-in-progress.** Use at your own risk.

To reset the Komodo blockchain change into the *~/.komodo* data directory and delete the corresponding files by running `rm -rf blocks chainstate debug.log komodostate db.log`

#### Create komodo.conf

Create a komodo.conf file:

```
mkdir ~/.komodo
cd ~/.komodo
touch komodo.conf

#Add the following lines to the komodo.conf file:
rpcuser=yourrpcusername
rpcpassword=yoursecurerpcpassword
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
txindex=1
addnode=5.9.102.210
addnode=78.47.196.146
addnode=178.63.69.164
addnode=88.198.65.74
addnode=5.9.122.241
addnode=144.76.94.38
addnode=89.248.166.91
```
### Create your own Blockchain based on Komodo

Komodo allows anyone to create a runtime fork which represents an independent Blockchain. Below are the detailed instructions:
Setup two independent servers with at least 1 server having a static IP and build komodod on those servers.  

#### On server 1 (with static IP) run:
```shell
./komodod -ac_name=name_of_your_chain -ac_supply=100000 -bind=ip_of_server_1 &
```

#### On server 2 run:
```shell
./komodod -ac_name=name_of_your_chain -ac_supply=100000 -addnode=ip_of_server_1 -gen &
```

**Komodo is based on Zcash which is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk.

**NOTE TO EXCHANGES:**
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1605144.msg17732151#msg17732151
There is a small chance that an outbound transaction will give an error due to mismatched values in wallet calculations. There is a -exchange option that you can run komodod with, but make sure to have the entire transaction history under the same -exchange mode. Otherwise you will get wallet conflicts.

**To change modes:**

a) backup all privkeys (launch komodod with `-exportdir=<path>` and `dumpwallet`)  
b) start a totally new sync including `wallet.dat`, launch with same `exportdir`  
c) stop it before it gets too far and import all the privkeys from a) using `komodo-cli importwallet filename`  
d) resume sync till it gets to chaintip  

For example:
```shell
./komodod -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli dumpwallet example
./komodo-cli stop
mv ~/.komodo ~/.komodo.old && mkdir ~/.komodo && cp ~/.komodo.old/komodo.conf ~/.komodo.old/peers.dat ~/.komodo
./komodod -exchange -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli importwallet /tmp/example
```
