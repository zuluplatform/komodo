/*
 CCassetstx has the functions that create the EVAL_ASSETS transactions. It is expected that rpc calls would call these functions. For EVAL_ASSETS, the rpc functions are in rpcwallet.cpp
 
 CCassetsCore has functions that are used in two contexts, both during rpc transaction create time and also during the blockchain validation. Using the identical functions is a good way to prevent them from being mismatched. The must match or the transaction will get rejected.
